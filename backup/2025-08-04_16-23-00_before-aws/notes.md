# Notes for project 

## TODO
* Add a landing page
  * Move Add course to top right corner 

* Managing backups within the app
  * How long should backups be kept? 
    * Diffrence between course and student
      * Student should be kept as long as a course exists
    * A course could be auto removed after example 6 months
    * Maybe a feature that allows all current deleted courses to be removed now?
  
* Breadcrumbs style navigation in top right corner
  * The links now are messy 

* Two node processes running
  * They are not closing after exiting the app

* Should JS be separated from html files? 

* Is it possible to create a assignment that has diffrent levels on multiple grades? 
    * Test with Planing C Green AND Utf√∂rande E Green
    * Also means changes to the edit function of the created assignments 

* UI UX changes for the admin page

* AI suggested changes to improve the app?

* Hide students so there is no need to delete them? 

* Possible to create a new assignment for ALL students at once?

    * Have it created without a color from start? 

    * Manage the UI for bulk assignment creation | Have the user create assignment that is stored and can be applyed to student in diffrent ways later. 

    * How can created assignments that are stored be managed? Edited? 

* How is student data stored and is it reusable if the app is updated?

    * Move the data to a database, SQLite?

* If a user does not have NodeJS or the packages installed, can this be automated?
